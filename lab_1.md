## Installing Visual Studio Code
To download the application, go to the Visual Studio Code website ([Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

Click on the big blue download button
* If you have a different operating system, click on the dropdown menu and select your respective OS

Opening the application will give you this screen:

Don't mind the files under "Recent"

## Remotely Connecting
Since I have a MacBook, I did not have to worry about installing *git* 

To open a new Terminal, I put my cursor to the top of the screen and clicked on "Terminal"

Then you click "New Terminal" and it should look like this:

We now want to connect to the server by inputting:
`$ ssh cs15lsp23ru@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
* Make sure not to include "$" as the terminal already provides it for you
* Take out the two letters "ru" and replace it with your two letters from your log-in info

Example:
> My log-in: cs15lsp23ru@ieng6.ucsd.edu
> Change: cs15lsp23~~ru~~@ieng6.ucsd.edu
> Example: cs15lsp23st@ieng6.ucsd.edu
