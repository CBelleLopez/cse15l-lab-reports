# Lab Report 3 - Researching Commands
## Find -o
One way to use the find command is to use it with -o.
This command displays the matched string on new lines found within the file.
For the first example, I used the command on a txt file in plos called pmed.0010008.txt.

Input:

`grep -o "disease" plos/pmed.0010008.txt`

Output:

```
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
disease
```
